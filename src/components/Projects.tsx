        description: "Automated the detection of fake news. Built and trained a suitable machine learning model using feature extraction techniques like Count vectorizer and TF-IDF vectorizer from NLP to clean and extract the features for prediction. Applied Voting Classifier to create a hybrid model that trains on collection of several individual base models and predicts the output label based on the combined majority of voting for each output class and obtained an accuracy of 95.9% with TF-IDF vectorizer.",
